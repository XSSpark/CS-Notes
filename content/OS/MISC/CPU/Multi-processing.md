## Abstract
---
- Having multiple [[Process]] running at the same time on [[Multi-core chips]], offers true [[High-performance Computing#Parallelism (并行性)|Parallelism(并行性)]]
- Can avoid issues like [[Deadlock (死锁)]] & [[Race Condition (竞态条件)]] faced by [[Multi-threading]] effectively but more resource heavy, because not sharing the same [[Address Space]], but independent [[Address Space]] comes with a cost 
- Performance limited by the *number of CPU cores*
