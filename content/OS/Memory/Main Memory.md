## Abstract
---
- Made of [[#Memory Element]], which can be assessed using [[#Physical Address]] in a [[#Random-Access]] manner which is very efficient
- We use [[#Memory Frames]] for easier memory management 
- Example [[RAM]]

## Memory Element
---
- A device which can remember value *indefinitely*
- Change value on command from its inputs
- A basic unit of storage element, able to store 1 [[Computer Data Representation#Bit]]
- 2 Types - [[Latch]] & [[Flip-flops]]

### Physical Address
- The address that points to a collection of [[#Memory Element]], usually 8 to form 1 [[Computer Data Representation#Byte]]

## Memory Frames
---
- *Fixed-size blocks* that are obtained by dividing the [[Main Memory]]
- All frames share the same size 
- Size determined by the [[OS]] & [[Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)]]. 
- Represent actual blocks of Main Memory that hold [[Data]] & [[Instruction]]



## Terminologies
---
### Random-Access
- A random specific memory location can be accessed instantly without waiting to render until that location
