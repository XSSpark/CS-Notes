## Abstract
---
- Made of [[#Memory Element]]
- Example [[RAM]]


## Terminologies
---
### Physical Address
- The address of each physical [[#Memory Element]]

### Random-Access
- A random specific memory location can be accessed instantly without waiting to render until that location 
### Memory Frames
- *Fixed-size blocks* that are obtained by dividing the [[Main Memory]]
- All frames share the same size 
- Size determined by the [[OS]] & [[Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)]]. 
- Represent actual blocks of Main Memory that hold [[Data]] & [[Instruction]]

### Memory Element
- A device which can remember value *indefinitely*
- Change value on command from its inputs
- A basic unit of storage element, able to store 1 [[Computer Data Representation#Bit]]
- 2 Types - [[Latch]] & [[Flip-flops]]
