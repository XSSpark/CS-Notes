## Abstract
---
- A [[Instruction]] in [[Kernel Space]] starts a transition from [[Privilege Level#User Mode]] to [[Privilege Level#Kernel Mode]], jumping from the programâ€™s code to the execution at a *fixed address* within the [[Kernel]] - [[Interrupt Handler]]
- A type of [[Signal (Software Interrupt)]]
- *Return Address* is saved on the [[Address Space#Stack Segment]] for use later

>[!example] For x86-64, it is [INT](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/intn:into:int3:int1) is a *Trap Interrupt*
