## Abstract
---
- Decides on hardware allocation and management with regard to software


>[!example]
>- [[MacOs Setup | MacOs]]'s kernel is **XNU**
>- **Windows**'s kernel is **NT Kernel**


## 2 Type 
---
### Micro-kernel 
- [[Kernel]] only handles critical part of the system like [[Inter-Process Communication (IPC)]]. The rest runs in [[User Space]]

>[!success] So one crash in the kernel [[Process]] doesn't crash the entire system 

>[!caution] Lower performance due to the overhead of communication between different modules

>[!example] 
>- [[MINIX]]

### Monolithic Kernel
- ðŸš§ WIP

## Terminologies 
---
### Preemptive Kernel
- [[Kernel]] that can be [[Interrupts (ä¸­æ–­) |interrupted]] and scheduled just like [[Process]] in the [[User Space]] 

>[!success] This prevents the Kernel from hogging the [[CPU]], and slow down user space process
