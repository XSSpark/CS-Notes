>[!note] 3 Properties that are different from [[File System (Directory Hierarchy)]]
>- Usually not very deep (more than 3 levels is unusual)
>- Short-lived - mins
>- Only parent process may control & even access a child process

>[!caution] [[Windows]] does not follow the above concept - all processes are equal.
