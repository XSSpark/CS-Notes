## Abstract
---
- Generated by the executing program itself. To accomplish [[User Space]] to [[Kernel Space]] control transfers
- [[Interrupts (中断)#RISCV CLINT|A CPU Feature]]
- [[Interrupts (中断)#Synchronous]]
- Can be generated by [[Instruction]] like [[Trap Interrupt (陷入)]]
- An example is [[Alarm Signal]]

## Mechanism
---
1. Causes [[Process]] to temporarily suspend
2. Save its [[Registers]] on the [[Stack (FILO)]]
3. When [[Interrupt Handler (Interrupt Service Routine, ISR)]] is done, the running [[Process]] is restarted in the state it was in just before the signal

## Benefits
---
### Better Security
- Programs in [[User Space]] switching themselves is dangerous 
- With Software Interrupt, the [[CPU]] is preconfigured by [[OS]] with where in the [[OS]] code to jump to


## Examples
---
### Alarm Signal
- Sent after a specified number of seconds has elapsed to notify a [[Process]] of an *event*
- [[Signal (Software Interrupt)]]
