- Stands for *Portable Operating System Interface*
- *A set of standards* enforced by IEEE, specifying the interface between [[OS]] and [[OS System Program]]
- Implements a set of automated conformance test to check if an OS is POSIX-compatible
- Defines Standard [[C]] operations, [[Multi-tasking]] and commands etc
- Has about 100 [[Library Call]], but not one-to-one mapping to [[System Call (系统调用)]]. Below is a list of major POSIX system calls
