## Abstract
---
- A shared key both entities have, used to encrypt [[Data]] and decrypt [[Ciphertext (密文)]]
- One entity needs to find a way to pass the key to another entity - can be solved by. [[Asymmetric Cryptography]]



## Terminologies
---
### AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- A [[Symmetric Encryption]] algorithm
### Symmetric Key
- The key that is shared between [[Host#Client]] and [[Host#Server]] to encrypt communication
- Much more efficient encryption that [[Asymmetric Cryptography]]
