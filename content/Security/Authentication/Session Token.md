#security 
## Abstract
- A unique identifier that is used to identify a session between a user and a website or web application
- It is typically generated by the server after receiving a valid set of username and password and stored in the user's browser. The session token is associated with that particular user, and is used to authenticate the user's requests and to maintain state between requests
- Stored inside [[Cookie]]

## Benefit
- Usually comes with [[TTL]], and the token value has no relationship with the user password. So when a session token is leaked, the risk of data loss is smaller

## Cons
- [[servers]] need to store the Session inside the [[RAM]] or [[Database]]. With a ton of user traffic, this may lead to traffic overloading
