## Abstract
---
- Facilities the integration between [[OOP]] concepts with low level [[Primitive Datatype]]

## Boxing
- Take a [[Primitive Datatype]] & put it inside an [[OOP#OOP Object]] of [[Wrapper Class Datatype]]
- Aka converting primitive to object 
## Auto-boxing
- [[Primitive and Object Conversion]] but without explicitly the use of `new` keyword, [[Compiler]] does the work automatically 


## Unboxing
- The opposite of [[#Boxing]]
```java
int intVal = numObject.intValue();
```

## Auto-unboxing
* [[#Unboxing]] but without explicitly calling built-in method
