## Abstract
---
- Human-readable names given to the [[Host]]
- [[#Domain Name]], [[Local Hostname]] and [[Unsolved Hostname]] are all considered as hostname

### Limitation
- No enough information about the location within the [[Internet]] of the [[Host]]
- Difficult to process by [[Routers]]
- Can be solved by using [[IP Address]]

### Domain Name
- Examples are `notes.yxy.ninja` and  `google.com` etc

### Canonical Hostname (CNAME)
- A less readable [[Hostname]]

> [!example]
> My blog Cloudfront URL: ``d29nyp1p0lllzw.cloudfront.net``

### Alias Hostname
- A more readable [[Hostname]], usually aliasing to [[#Canonical Hostname (CNAME)]] or [[IP Address]]
