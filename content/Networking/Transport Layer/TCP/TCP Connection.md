## Abstract
---
- Established after [[TCP Handshake]]
</br>

- Usually browser will keep multiple TCP Connection to the same [[Host#Server]] to have a balance between good performance & resource usage([[Chrome]] & [[Firefox]] default 6)

>[!caution] Resource intensive on both [[Host]] & [[Host]] side because [[TCP#^228bd9 | TCP is Stateful]]
