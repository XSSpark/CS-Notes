## Abstract
- Made of 2 [[Transistors (晶体管)]]
![[OR.png]]
>[!note] Represented
>$$A+B$$



## Use Cases
### Turn on Low-level Flags
- Low-level things like [[Interrupts (中断)]] is represented in one bit, different [[Interrupts (中断)]] has different bit
- We can use the *OR Gate* on the current status and the flags we want to turn on
