## Abstract
--- 
- [[Sequential Circuit]] that is [[Sequential Circuit#Level Sensitive]], thus the changes to state are not **syn·chro·nized** to a particular timing
- Usually operate based on **events** or **conditions**

>[!caution] Limited Control over State Changes
> 



>[!example]
>- [[Set Reset Latch]]
>- [[Data Latch]]
