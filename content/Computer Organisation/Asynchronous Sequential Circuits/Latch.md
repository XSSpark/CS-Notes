## Abstract
---
- [[Asynchronous Sequential Circuit]] that is able to remember a [[Computer Data Representation#Bit]] when the input power is off

### Steering Gate
- Introduces a **control input** that determines whether the [[Latch]] is in a **transparent**(allows data to pass through) or **opaque** state(holds its current state, blocking any changes from the input)
- When the steering gate is active (usually set to a certain logic level), the latch becomes transparent
- Often used in digital circuits for **synchronization** and **control purposes**
