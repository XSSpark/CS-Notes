## Abstract
---
- *Control input* that determines whether the [[Latch]] is in a transparent(allows data to pass through) or opaque state(holds its current state, blocking any changes from the input)
- When the steering gate is active (usually set to a certain logic level), the latch becomes transparent
- Often used in digital circuits for synchronization and control purposes
