## Abstract
---
- We should design circuit that is **cost-effective** and **efficient**
- The language we use is [[Boolean Algebra]]
</br>

- [[Logic Gates#Gate Delay]] will decide the maximum [[Clock Oscillator#Clock Frequency]]

## 2 Directions of Thoughts
---
### Design Circuit Forward
- Have a task in mind
- Break down to logical steps
- Pick the appropriate [[Logic Gates]] that fulfil the steps to build the desired circuit

### Design Circuit Backward
- Think about the solution, without thinking about the logic steps taken to reach the solution
- What outputs with given the a set of inputs
- Solve the problems based on the results we want
- Simple Process but uses a lot of [[Logic Gates]], can be reduced with the use of [[Karnaugh Map]]
	1. Come up with a [[Truth Table]] first
	2. For each true records, we connect the inputs using [[AND]] gates
	3. WIP
