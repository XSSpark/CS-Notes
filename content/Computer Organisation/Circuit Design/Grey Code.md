## Abstract
---
- Also known as *Reflected Binary Code*, *Unit Distance Code*, *Minimum Error Code*
- In [[Bit String]] form, another way to represent binary number 
- Can be used to generate [[Karnaugh Map]]
- [[#Unweighted Code]]
- 2 ways to generate - [Reflect & Prefix](https://youtu.be/jOCTDgmFlGs?t=78) & [Binary to Gray Code Conversion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF-Q5j7RUEw)


## Benefits
---
### Reduced Bit Switching Operation
- Only one bit is changed at any adjacent pair 

## Terminologies
---
### Unweighted Code
- The position of the digit doesn't have value
