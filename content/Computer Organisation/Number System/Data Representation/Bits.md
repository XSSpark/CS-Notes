>[!note] Either 1 or 0


>[!note] N bit can represent 2^N values, can be obtain by 2^N-1 + .. 2^0
>Given 2 bits, it can be 00, 01, 10, 11 -> corresponding to 0,1,2,3

>[!note] The maximum value for N bit can be found 2 ways
>1. ``2^N - 1`` -> ``2^2 -1 = 3``
>2. ``2^N-1 + .. 2^0`` -> ``2^1 + 2^0 = 3``
