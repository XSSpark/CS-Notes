## Abstract 
* For negative number, all bits are inverted except the sign bit which is 1 when we need to perform the computation
![[1s_complement.png]]
* We can use this in addition computation directly, without building extra logic circuit 
* We will have +0 & -0, can be solved by [[2's Complement]]
