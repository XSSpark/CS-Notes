## Abstract
- We are adding extra 1 to the [[1's Complement (反码)]]
- This makes sure that there is only one `0` by adding 1 to after converting from [[Sign-and-Magnitude (原码)]] to [[1's Complement (反码)]]
- This is the form that computers use to store integers

## Conversion
### From 2's Complement back to Dec
- Taken the value [[Sign-and-Magnitude (原码)#Sign Bit]] (negative if it is `1`) and perform addition with value of whole [[Sign-and-Magnitude (原码)#Magnitude]] (all are positive)
