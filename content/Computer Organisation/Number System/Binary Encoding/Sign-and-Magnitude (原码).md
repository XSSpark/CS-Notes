## Abstract
- Represent positive and negative decimal integers in binary
- Divide the number of bits into 2 parts, one part for negative number, another part for positive number


## Cons
### Require extra [[Logic Gates]]
- The [[Adder]] logic cant be used for subtraction
- This can be avoided using [[1's Complement (反码)]] or [[2's Complement (补码)]]
