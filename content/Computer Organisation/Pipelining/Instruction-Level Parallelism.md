## Abstract
- Allow [[CPU]] to start the next [[Computer Organisation/Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)/Instruction | Instruction]] without the current [[Computer Organisation/Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)/Instruction | Instruction]] to finish, since [[Pipeline Stages]] are independent of each other on a hardware-level
- However, certain combinations of [[Instruction]] back to back can create [[Read-After-Write(RAW) Hazard]]
