## Abstract
---
![[sequential_circuit.png|500]]
- Present output = [[Combination Circuit]] + [[#Sequential Circuit State]]
- We need to store the past output, thus a [[Main Memory#Memory Element]] is needed. The diagram above has the memory element included inside
</br>

- 2 types
	- [[Synchronous Sequential Circuit]] ([[Flip-flops]])
	- [[Asynchronous Sequential Circuit]] ([[Register]])


## Terminologies
---
### Sequential Circuit State
- Also known as feedback
- Past outputs


### Multivibrator
- A class of [[Sequential Circuit]]
	1. [[Bistable (2 stable states)]]
	2. [[Monostable or one-shot (1 stable state)]]
	3. [[Astable (no stable state)]]
