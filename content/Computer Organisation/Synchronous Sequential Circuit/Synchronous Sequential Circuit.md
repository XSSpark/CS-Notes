## Abstract
---
![[sychronous_sequential_circuit.png|500]]

- [[#Edge-triggered]] with `CLK` which is the [[Clock Oscillator#Clock Signal]]
- [[Propagation delay]] of [[Logic Gates]] will decide the maximum [[Clock Frequency]]






## Terminologies 
---
### Edge-triggered

![[positive_edge_triggered.png|400]]

- Output only changes at a specific time, usually when [[Clock Oscillator#Clock Signal]] change from one edge to another
