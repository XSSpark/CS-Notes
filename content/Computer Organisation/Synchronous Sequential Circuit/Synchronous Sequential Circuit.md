## Abstract
---
![[sychronous_sequential_circuit.png|500]]

- [[#Edge-triggered]] with `CLK` which is the [[Clock Oscillator#Clock Signal]]







## Terminologies 
---
### Edge-triggered

![[positive_edge_triggered.png|400]]

- Output only changes at a specific time, usually when [[Clock Oscillator#Clock Signal]] change from one edge to another
- 2 types
	- **Positive edge triggering:** Transition from a low voltage (0) to a high voltage (1) on the [[Clock Oscillator#Clock Signal]]
	- **Negative edge triggering:** Transition from a high voltage (1) to a low voltage (0) on the [[Clock Oscillator#Clock Signal]]
