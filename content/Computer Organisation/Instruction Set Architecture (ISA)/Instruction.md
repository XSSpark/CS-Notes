## Abstract
- [[Bit String]] stored in the [[Main Memory]]
- Passed to CPU to get translated to carry out [[Operation]]
- Doesn't specify which [[CPU Component]] does what, just specify what outputs are expected with a given input
- The instruction lifecycle can be broken down into [[Pipeline Stages]]
- Made up of 2 parts - [[#Opcode]] & [[#Parameter]]


## Terminologies
### Opcode
- Config for [[Control Unit]] to carry the desired [[Operation]]
- [[MIPS]], 6-bits, 2^6 -> 64 combinations 
### Parameter
- [[Registers]] Address
- [[Memory Address]]
- Immediate Value
### Branch
- An [[Instruction]] that causes [[Process]] to jump to a different location in the codes
