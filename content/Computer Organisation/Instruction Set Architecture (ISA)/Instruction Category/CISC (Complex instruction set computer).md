## Abstract
- Very Complex set of [[Instruction]]
- Can take multiple cycles to execute

## Pros
- Has many [[Instruction]], to a point complex [[Operation]] can be performed with just one [[Instruction]]
## Cons
### Requires More [[Transistors (晶体管)]]
- [[CPU]] design needs to be complex to achieve complex [[Operation]] with few [[Instruction]]
- Less [[Transistors (晶体管)]] can be used improve overall computing performance 
### More Power Hungry
- Because [[#Requires More Transistors (晶体管)]]
### Wasted Power
- When performing simple [[Operation]]
### Harder to Decode
- Each [[Instruction]] is variable-sized
