## Abstract
- Simplified [[Instruction]] that can complete in one [[Clock Cycle]]
- Fewer possible [[Instruction]]
- Doesn't perform any [[Operation]] directly on [[Main Memory]]


## Pros
### Easier to Decode
- Each [[Instruction]] is fixed-sized
### Power-Efficient
- Needs fewer [[Transistors (晶体管)]]
- Great efficiency when performing simple [[Operation]]

## Cons
- Complex [[Operation]] requires more [[Instruction]] to achieve
