## Abstract
- A set of [[Computer Organisation/Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)/Instruction| instructions]] which contains [[Instruction#Opcode]] & parameters
- Aka the language the [[CPU]] speaks

## Benefit
### Portability
- Implementation of [[CPU]] is decoupled. The same Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) can be used on different [[CPU]]
- App written in X86 can be run on all the CPU that implements the X86 


## 2 Categories
1. [[RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)]]
	- X86 developed by Intel
1. [[CISC (Complex instruction set computer)]]
	- ARM developed by Acorn Computer
	- [[MIPS]]
