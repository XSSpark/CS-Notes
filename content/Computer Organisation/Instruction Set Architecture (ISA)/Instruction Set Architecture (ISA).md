## Abstract
- A set of [[Computer Organisation/Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)/Instruction| instructions]] which contains [[Instruction]] & parameters
- Aka the language the [[CPU]] speaks

## Benefit
- Implementation of [[CPU]] is decoupled. The same [[Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)]] can be used on different [[CPU]]
>[!example] App written in X86 can be run on all the CPU that implements the X86 


## 2 Categories
1. [[RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)]]
2. [[CISC (Complex instruction set computer)]]

## Examples
 - [[MIPS (RISC)]]
 - x86: a [[CISC (Complex instruction set computer)]] developed by Intel
 - ARM: a [[RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)]] developed by Acorn Computer
