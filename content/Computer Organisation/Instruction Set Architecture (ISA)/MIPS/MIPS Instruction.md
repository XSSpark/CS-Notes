## Abstract
- The [[Instruction]] may specify 3  [[Registers]] - [[#Destination Register]], [[#Source Register]] & [[#Target Register]]



## Terminologies
### Destination Register 
- 5bits
- Labeled `rd`, mapped to `WR`
- [[Registers]] that gets the result of [[Operation]] in [[MIPS R-Type Instruction]] [[Instruction]]
### Source Register 
- 5bits
- Labeled `rs`, mapped to `RR1`
- [[Registers|Register]] with value stored that we want to use to carry out [[Operation]]
### Target Register
- 5 bits
- Labeled `rt`, mapped to `RR2`
- [[Registers|Register]] with value stored we want to use in [[MIPS R-Type Instruction]] [[Instruction]]
- [[Registers|Register]] that gets the result of [[Operation]] in [[MIPS I-Type Instruction]]
