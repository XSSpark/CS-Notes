## Abstract
---
[[CPU]]'s instruction execution process


## Single Cycle Execution
---
- All [[Pipeline Stages]] performed within a [[Clock Cycle]]
- Time taken for one Clock Cycle depends on the slowest [[Instruction]]

>[!caution] All [[Instruction]] will take the same time as the slowest instruction


## Multi Cycle Execution
---
- Breaks down [[Pipeline Stages]] into multiple [[Clock Cycle]]
