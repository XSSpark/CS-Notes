## Abstract
---
-  At [[Memory Address]] `0x02000000`
- *CLINT* stands for *Core-Local Interrupt Controller*,  a hardware component in the RISC-V architecture that provides a simple and efficient mechanism for *generating interrupts within a core*
- Mainly 2 features:
	1) *Machine-mode* [[Signal (Software Interrupt)]]
		- Generated by writing to the CLINT's `msip` [[Registers]]
	2) *Machine-mode* timer interrupts
		- CLINT's [[Timer Chips]], which is a 32-bit countdown timer that can be programmed to generate interrupts at a specified frequency, useful for [[Multitasking#Preemptive Multitasking]]

## Components
---
### MTIMECMP
- Start at [[Memory Address]] `0x02004000`
- Stands for *Machine Time Compare*
- [[Registers|Register]] used to generate *machine-level* timer interrupts
- Each *CPU Core* has one
- Implement both periodic timers and *one-shot* timers
### MTIME
- At [[Memory Address]] `0x02000000 + 0xBFF8 = 0x0200BFF8`
- A 64-bit [[Registers]] that stores the current value of the [[Timer Chips]]
