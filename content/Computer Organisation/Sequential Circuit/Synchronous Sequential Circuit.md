## Abstract
---
- [[Sequential Circuit]] that is [[Sequential Circuit#Edge-triggered]], aka the state only changes at specific moment synchronised with [[Clock Oscillator#Clock Signal]], not a continuous period of time

>[!success] Benefit of Synchronisation
> Ability to coordinate and manage the flow of information within the circuit, making it easier to **design** and **analyze**
