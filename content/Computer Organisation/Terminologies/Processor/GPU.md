## Abstract
---
- A [[Multi-core chips]] with thousands of tiny cores


## Benefits
---
### Optimised for Parallel Computing
### Allows games to perform a ton of Linear Algebra in parallel
- We can calculate pixels in batches or parallel 
### Great for AI related work
- Allow training Deep Learning Models that perform tons Matrix Multiplication on dataset

## Cons
---
### Hard to program

## Comparison with CPU
---
[[CPU]] one core is way more power, and able to handle complication logics like [[Branching]]. A lot of the real world application needs to run [[Instruction]] in a sequential manner

GPU shines when we need [[High-performance Computing#Parallelism (并行性)]]
