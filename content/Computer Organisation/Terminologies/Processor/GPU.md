> - A [[Multi-core chips]] with thousands of tiny cores

>[!success] Optimised for [[Parallel Computing]]

>[!success] Allows games to perform a ton of [[linear Algebra]] in parallel
>- We can calculate pixels in batches or parallel 

>[!success] Allow training [[Deep Learning Models]] that perform tons [[Matrix Multiplication]] on dataset

>[!note] Comparison with [[CPU]]
>![[cpu vs gpu comparison.png]]
>>[!caution] [[CPU]] one core is way more power, and able to handle complication logics like [[Branching]]. A lot of the real world application needs to run [[Instruction]] in a sequential manner

>[!caution] Hard to program
