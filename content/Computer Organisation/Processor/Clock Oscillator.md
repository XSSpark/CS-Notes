## Abstract
---
- A hardware component inside [[CPU]] that generates [[#Clock Signal]] to control the speed of CPU processing [[Instruction]]


## Clock Signal
---
![[clock_signal.png|300]]
- Represented with `CLK`
- The continuous oscillating square wave that drives the timing of a digital system
- Used to synchronise the [[Operation]] of various components within the circuit


### Clock Cycle
![[clock_cycle.png|300]]
- Refers to the time interval between two successive rising (or falling) edges of the [[Clock Signal]]

### Duty Cycle
![[duty_cycle.png|350]]

- The ratio of time the [[Clock Signal]] is in the high state (logical 1) to the total period of the signal
