## Abstract
---
- Understand the [[Instruction]] based on the corresponding [[Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)]] 
- Then decide what [[Register]], [[ALU]] & [[Main Memory]] to enable to carry out the [[Operation]] by generating [[#Control Signal]]

## Components
---
### Program Counter
- Also known as *Instruction Address Register*, *Instruction Pointer*
- [[Register]] contains the [[Memory Address]] of the next [[Instruction]] to be executed by the [[CPU]]


## Terminologies
---
### Control Signal
- Electric signals that tells [[CPU Datapath]], [[Main Memory]] & [[IO Device]] what to do according to program [[Instruction]]
