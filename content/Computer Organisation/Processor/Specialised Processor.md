## Abstract
---
- [[CPU]] designed for specialised purposes 


## DPU (Data Processing Unit)
---
- Function like  [[CPU]] & usually based on [[ARM]]
- Highly optimised for [[Data Transfer]]
- Handles [[Network Operations]] & data storage (encryption & compression etc)
- The goal is to do the data processing job for the general CPU

## QPU (Quantum Processing Unit)
---
- Deal with [[Computer Data Representation#Qubit]] instead of [[Computer Data Representation#Bit]]
- Deal with [[Quantum Gates]] instead of [[Logic Gates]]

## TPU (Tensor Processor Unit)
---
- Function like [[GPU]], but designed specifically for [[Tensor Operation]]
- Contains thousands of [[Multiply Accumulators]] that allow hardware to perform [[Matrix Multiplication]] without accessing [[Register]] or [[Shared Memory]] like a GPU would
