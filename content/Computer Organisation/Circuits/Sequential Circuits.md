## Abstract
![[sequential_circuit.png]]
- Present output = [[Combination Circuit]] + [[#State]]
- We need to store the past outputs -> a [[Main Memory]] is needed 
- 2 types - [[Synchronous Sequential Circuits]], [[Asynchronous Sequential Circuits]]
- Examples are [[Flip-flops]] & [[Registers]]


## Terminologies
### State
- Also known as feedback
- Past outputs
