## Abstract
- Takes in 3 [[Bits]]
- Built with 2 [[Half Adder]]
- The sum of the 1st [[Half Adder]] is added with the `cin` by the 2nd [[Half Adder]]
- The sum output of the 2nd [[Half Adder]] is the final sum & the `cout` is the final `cout`
- For the `cout`, we need to have an *OR Gate* to pipe out the final `cout` to handle situation where the first [[Half Adder]]'s `cout` is 1 while the `cin` is 0 & sum of the first [[Half Adder]] is 0
