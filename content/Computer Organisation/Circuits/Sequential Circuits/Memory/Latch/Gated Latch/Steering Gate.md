>- Control input that determines whether the [[Latch]] is in a transparent or opaque state
>- When the steering gate is active (usually set to a certain logic level), the latch becomes transparent, meaning it allows data to pass through from its input to its output
>- When the steering gate is inactive, the latch becomes opaque, and it holds its current state, blocking any changes from the input

>[!success] Often used in digital circuits for synchronization and control purposes
