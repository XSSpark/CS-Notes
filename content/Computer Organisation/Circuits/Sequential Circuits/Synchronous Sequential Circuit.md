## Abstract
---
- Outputs change at specific time (with [[Clock Signal]]) [[#Edge-triggered]]
![[sychronous_sequential_circuit.png]]
- [[Propagation delay]] of [[Logic Gates]] will decide the maximum [[Clock Frequency]]



## Terminologies

### Edge-triggered
- Output only changes at a specific time, usually when [[Clock Signal]] change from one edge to another
