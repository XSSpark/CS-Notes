## Abstract
---
- Present output = [[Combination Circuit]] + [[#Sequential Circuit State]]
- We need to store the past outputs -> a [[Main Memory#Memory Element]] is needed 
- 2 types - [[Synchronous Sequential Circuit]], [[Asynchronous Sequential Circuit]]
- Examples are [[Flip-flops]] & [[Register]]

## Terminologies
---
### Sequential Circuit State
- Also known as feedback
- Past outputs


### Multivibrator
A class of [[Sequential Circuit]]
1. [[Bistable (2 stable states)]]
2. [[Monostable or one-shot (1 stable state)]]
3. [[Astable (no stable state)]]
