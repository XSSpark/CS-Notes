## Abstract
- 2 Main Components - [[ALU]],  [[Control Unit]]
- Fire the necessary components based on the given [[Instruction]]
- Start in [[Privilege Level#Kernel Mode | Kernel Mode]]. Before executing a program, the kernel initiates the switch to [[Privilege Level#User Mode | User Mode]]

## Benefits
- Optmised for computation that requires sequential execution(One [[Instruction]] after another [[Instruction]]), [[Branching]] and logic


## Terminologies
### Scratch Area
- A small amount of high-speed memory that is used to store temporary data
- Typically located on the *CPU* die itself
