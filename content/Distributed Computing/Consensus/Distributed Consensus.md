## Abstract
---
- Involving multiple [[Host]] agreeing on values
- Typically arises in the context of [[Replicated State Machine]]
- A fundamental problem in [[Fault-tolerant]] **Distributed Systems**


## Distributed Consensus Algorithms
---
- Typical types of these [[Algorithms]] make progress when majority of their [[Host]] is available
- Given 5 servers, if more than 2 is down, stop making progress & never return incorrect result
