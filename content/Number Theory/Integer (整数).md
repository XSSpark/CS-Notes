## Abstract
---
- Are **discrete objects**, so used a lot in [[Discrete Math]]


## Theorems
---
### Theorem 4.4.1
- *The Quotient-Remainder Theorem*
- Given any [[Integer (整数)]] `n` and positive integer `d`, there exist unique integers `q` and `r` such that
$$
(n = dq + r) \land (0 \le r < d )
$$

### Theorem 4.6.1
- *There is no greatest integer*
- Proved by [[Mathematical Proof#Proof by Contradiction (反证法)]]
