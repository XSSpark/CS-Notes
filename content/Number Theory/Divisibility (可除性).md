## Abstract
---
- `d|n` means that there is an integer `k` such as `n = dk`
- `d` is a factor of `n`
- `d|n` doesn't involve the actual division. It is a [[Mathematical Statement]] that is either `True` or `False`, not a numerical value
- Used frequently under the topic of **Relation**

## Theorems
---
### Theorem 4.3.1
- A positive divisor of a positive integer
- For all positive integers `a` and `b`, if `a|b`, then `a<=b` 
### Theorem 4.3.2
- Divisors of 1
- The only divisors of 1 are 1 and -1
