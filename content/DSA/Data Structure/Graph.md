## Abstract
---
- 

## 3 Ways to Represent
---
### Adjacency Matrix
#### Pros
- Check the relationship of any 2 nodes in O(1)
#### Cons
- Space wastage for [[#Sparse Graph]]
### Adjacency List
#### Pros
- Easy to manipulate using programming language
### Adjacency Set


## Terminologies
---
### Weighted (加权图)
- [[Binary Tree (二叉树)#Edge | Edge]] has a value
### Directed
- 
### Non-Directed

### Sparse Graph
- A graph in which the number of edges is much less than the possible number of edges
