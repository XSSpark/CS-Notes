>[!note] 3 parts
>1. Analysis [[Complexity Analysis]] & [[Complexity Analysis]]
>2. Related with the input size
>3. Observing the trend when input size gets bigger

>[!note] Benefits
>- The analysis isn't limited to particular machine. It applies to all the machines

## 2 Types
### Space
### Time
>[!note] Find the time used by a particular [[Algorithms]] without basing on the machine's specs


>[!caution] We are thinking when the input size is approaching [[infinity]], what will be the complexity. So when the actual input size in real world is small, the algorithms with worst time complexity may run fast!
