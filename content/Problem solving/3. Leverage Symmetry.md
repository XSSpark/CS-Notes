>[!note]
>Basically obtaining another piece of information based on reflection/symmetry, basically buy one get one free


>[!example] Example 1: Approaching a problem related to Circle,  [[Math/Trigonometry/Assets/Inscribed Angle Theorem]]
>- Since the angle is 90degrees, 2 out 3 sides are the same. The 2 triangles obtained after divided are basically the same triangle, symmetry of each other
>- Thus, we can conclude that a == b, d == e
