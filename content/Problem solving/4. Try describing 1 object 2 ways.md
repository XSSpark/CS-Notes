#problem_solving 
>[!note]
>Basically explaining something in 2 different perspectives. For example, counting the possible permutation of a string of 5bits. 1) Count the exponential 2) Count the possible permutation one by one


>[!example] Example 1: Approaching a problem related to Circle,  [[Math/Trigonometry/Assets/Double-angle Formula for cosine]]
>- Proof cos2(a) == 1/2 * (1 + cos(2θ)) by describing the cos2(a) &  cos(2θ) on the graph
