## Abstract
---
- The use of an additional bit to check whether the *number of 1s* in a binary number is *even* or *odd*
- Used to detect *errors* in *data transmission* or *storage*
- 2 types - [[#Odd]] & [[#Even]], the bit value is the opposite, if odd number, then `0` for [[#Odd]], if even number, then `0` for [[#Even]]
- Commonly used with *ASCII*


## Terminologies
---
### Odd
- The parity bit is set to 
- `0` if the number of 1s is `odd`
- `1` if the number of 1s is `even`
- Can't produce a string that is all `0`

### Even
- The parity bit is set to 
- `0` if the number of 1s is `even`
- `1` if the number of 1s is `odd`
