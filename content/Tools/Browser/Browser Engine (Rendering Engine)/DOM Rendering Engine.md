## Abstract
- Convert [[HTML]] into [[DOM (Document Object Model)]]

## Steps
1. Load the [[HTML]]
2. Perform [[Tokenization]] - Each [[HTML Tag]] is extracted out and the information regarding it is encapsulated into an *Object*
3. Arrange the *Object* in order to form the final [[DOM (Document Object Model)]], and the *Object* is the node on the [[DOM (Document Object Model)]]
