## Abstract
---
- In order for us to use *Datadog services* on other platforms, we need to integrate with those platforms first. *Datadog* provides a [list of supported integrations](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/#all)

## Integrations
---
- Below is my notes of the integration I did
### AWS Integration
- There are [many ways](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/amazon_web_services/) to integrate *AWS* with *Datadog*. The easiest way to start is [automated AWS integration using CloudFormation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/integrations/aws/)
