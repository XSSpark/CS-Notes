## Abstract
---
- A list of interesting probability problems 

## Birthday Problem
---
- Deals with the likelihood of two people sharing the same birthday within a group
- The probability of a shared birthday becomes quite high with a relatively small number of people
</br>

- The question is usually framed like this: How many people need to be in a room for there to be a 50% chance that at least two of them share the same birthday?
- The counterintuitive answer is only **23 people** are needed to reach a probability of **approximately 50%**
</br>

- This phenomenon arises from the fact that there are numerous potential pairs of people who could share a birthday in a group, and as the group size increases, the probability of a shared birthday increases more rapidly than one might intuitively expect
