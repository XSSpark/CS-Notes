## Abstract
---
- [[Single Point of Responsibility]]


## Rust Function
---
- For [[#Function Signature]], you _must_ declare the [[Datatype]] of each parameter
- So [[Language Processors#Compiler]] almost never needs you to use the function elsewhere in the code to figure out what type you mean. The compiler is also able to give more helpful error messages if it knows what types the function expects.
</br>

- Return the last [[Expression]] implicitly


## Terminologies
---
### Function Signature 
- Refers to the declaration of a function
- Including its name, return [[Datatype]], and parameter datatype
