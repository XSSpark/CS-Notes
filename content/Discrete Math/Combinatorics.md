## Abstract
---
- Deals with [[Counting]], [[Permutation]] and [[Combination]] of objects etc
- "How many ways can a certain event occur?" or "How many arrangements are possible with a given set of elements?"



### Binomial Coefficient
$$
C(n,k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
$$

- $C(n, k)$ is the **number of ways**, **disregarding order**, that $k$ objects **can be chosen** from among $n$ objects
</br>

- Also known as the number of **k-element** [[Set#Subset]] (or **k-combinations**) of a **n-element** [[Set]] 
</br>

- $C(n, k)$ gives the [[#Coefficient]] of one of the **term** of the **expansion** [[#Binomial]] $(a+b)^n$ 
- The term is expressed as $a^{n-k} \times b^{k}$
#### Binomial
- **Bi** means two
- A mathematical expression or algebraic equation that consists of **two terms** connected by a **plus** or **minus** sign, general form is $(a+b)$ or $(a-b)$
#### Coefficient
- Constant [[Factor]] that multiplies a variable
- For example,  $5$ is the coefficient of $5x$
