## Abstract
---
- Deals with [[Counting]], [[Permutation]] and [[Combination]] of objects etc
- "How many ways can a certain event occur?" or "How many arrangements are possible with a given set of elements?"


### Triangle Inequality Theorem
- In order to form a **closed triangle**, $(a+b \gt c) \cap (a+c \gt b) \cap (b+c \gt a)$, where $a,b,c$ are the 3 sides of the triangle
- We call triangle that fails to meet Triangle Inequality **degenerate** 
- For triangles that meet Triangle Inequality, we call them **non-degenerate**
</br>

- Triangle inequality theorem
