## Abstract
---
- Deals with [[Counting]], [[Permutation]] and [[Combination]] of objects etc
- "How many ways can a certain event occur?" or "How many arrangements are possible with a given set of elements?"
- Usually, the goal is to find a way to **count the combinations** efficiently without **generating each combination** separately
