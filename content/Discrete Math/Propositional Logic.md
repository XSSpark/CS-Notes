## Abstract
---
- The logic of [[Mathematical Statement#Compound Statement]]

## Theorems
---
### Theorem 2.1.1
- [[#Logical Equivalence]]
- Refer to the lectures notes for more details

## Terminologies 
---
### Ambiguous
- Happen without the proper use of parentheses to indicate the intended order of operations
- We need to use proper parentheses to ensure there's *only one way* to interpret and evaluate each expression
### Logical Equivalence
- When 2 [[Mathematical Statement]] have *identical truth values*
- 2 ways to check
	1) Truth table - Find a row where truth values are different
	2) Find a counter example - Substitute a concrete [[Mathematical Statement]] into the [[Mathematical Statement#Statement/Propositional Form]], then compare
- There are *laws* to have simplifies [[Mathematical Statement#Statement/Propositional Form]], we can only perform the *laws* when the exact form is matched
