## Abstract
---
- A *unordered* collection of [[#Object]]
- *Order* and *duplicates* don't matter
$$
\{9, 8, 7\} = {7, 9, 8} = {7, 8, 7, 9, 9, 7, 7}
$$




## Notation
---
### Set-Roster Notation
- A [[Discrete Math/Set|Set]] may be specified by writing all of its [[#Object]] between braces 
- Symbol `...` is called ellipsis and read "and so forth"
$$
\{1, 2, 3\}
$$
$$
\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 100\}
$$
$$
\{1,2,3, \ldots\}
$$

## Terminologies

### Object
- Members or elements of [[Discrete Math/Set|Set]]
- Example: `1`, `2`, `3` are objects in the set of [[Integer (整数)]]
