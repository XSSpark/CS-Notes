>[!note] What is it?
>- More intuitive way to see: Thinking in Circle (See the [[Sine (sin)]], [[Cosine (cos)]] & [[Tangent (tan)]]for example)
>- Conventional way of thinking it: Relate the [[Î˜ (Theta)]] of a [[Right-angled Triangle]] to the ratios of the sides of [[Right-angled Triangle]]


>[!tip] Has a strong association with [[Complex Number]]
