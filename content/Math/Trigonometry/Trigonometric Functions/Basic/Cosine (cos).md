#trigonometry 
$$
cos(θ) = \frac{adj}{hyp}
$$

>[!note] Thinking in terms of Circle (x-axis value)
>- The [[Θ (Theta)]] is basically the distance we travel on the circle perimeter
>- cos(θ) is the x-axis value, since hyp is radius which is always the same (radius 1, any thing divides 1 is the same. In this case, adj is the **x-axis**)
