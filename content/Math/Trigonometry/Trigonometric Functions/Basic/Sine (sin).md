$$
sin(θ) = \frac{opp}{hyp}
$$

>[!note] Thinking in terms of Circle (y-axis value)
>- The [[Θ (Theta)]] is basically the distance we travel on the circle perimeter
>- sin(θ) is the y-axis value, since hyp is radius which is always the same (radius 1, any thing divides 1 is the same. In this case, opp is the **y-axis**)
