>[!note] To uniquely differentiate different equation
>If every equation is represented with y, then we can't tell a difference. Instead with f(x), g(x), we can tell they are 2 different equations easily

>[!note] To point out the variable in equations
>- Given f(x), x is the variable
>- Given f(m), m is the variable


>[!note] Practice reverse operation
>Given f(x-1)=x^2 - 1, find f(x). Basically the idea is get back to the 1 variable in the f(). Can make use of. [[2. Giving things (meaningful) names]], give m = x-1, the substitute m to x^2-1, the replace m with x to get the answer
