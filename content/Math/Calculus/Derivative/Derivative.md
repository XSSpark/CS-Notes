## Formal Derivative Definition 
$$
\frac{df}{dx} (2) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(2+h)-f(2)}{h}
$$

where
$$
h = dx
$$
$$
dx \rightarrow 0
$$
## Abstract
- [[#dy]]/[[#dx]]
- A [[Function]] that gives the slope of [[Tangent]] line at a certain point(some x value)
   - [[Limit]] helps to find the value of derivative at any point of the graph of the original function
- Known as best constant approximation around a point
- Example is velocity of a distance-time graph


## Terminologies 
### Change
- The difference between 2 points
### dx
- A **very very very small value [[#Change]]** on the **x-axis**
- NOT "infinitely small" & 0, but "finitely small" & [[Limit|approaching 0]]
### dy
- A **very very very small value [[#Change]]** on the **y-axis**
