## Rule 1: If c is inside the domain of function, then [[Limit]] is f(c) as x approaches c
---

## Rule 2: If the [[Limit]] of 2 different functions are finite, then the algebraic operations on both apply to their [[Limit]]
---

## Rule 3: The quotient is zero when numerator is constant & denominator is increasing without bound
---

## Rules 4: [[Limit]] of common functions when x approaching infinity

## Rules 5: As x approaching c, the limit of function is unbounded if either y approaching positive [[Infinity (∞)]] or negative [[Infinity (∞)]]
