## Abstract
---
$$
\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} f(h)
$$

- The finite value that a function approaches as the input approaches some value

### 3 ways to compute limit
1. [[The l’Hôpital Rule]]
2. [[The Squeeze Theorem]]
3. Substitute the input value (the value x is approaching to) obtain the function output which is the limit

>[!note] What it means when a limit exist
>- Always find a [[Delta (δ)]] corresponds to **an output** within the [[Epsilon (ε)]]


>[!note] Undefined Limit
>![[undefined limit.png]]
>- Given an [[Delta (δ)]], there isn't an output within the [[Epsilon (ε)]]
>- [[Left Limit]] == [[Right Limit]]
