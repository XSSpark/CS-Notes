## Abstract
---
- 2 types - [[#Type 1]], [[#Type 2]]
- An improper integral is said to be convergent if the [[Limit]] exists; otherwise it is divergent
- Always remember to check for unbounded points


## Terminologies
---
### Type 1
- The [[upper bound]] or [[lower bound]] or both of the [[Integral, Anti-derivative]] is [[Infinity (âˆž)]]

### Type 2
- The [[Integrand]] is *unbounded* in the the interval of [[Integration]]
- Can be at either of the upper bound or lower bound, or a point within the interval
