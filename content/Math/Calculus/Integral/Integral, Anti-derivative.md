\int_a^b â€‹f(x)dx
$$
> [!note]
> - Inverse of [[Derivative]]
> - The area under graph given by a [[upper bound]] & [[lower bound]]
> - The upper bound - lower bound cancels off the the constant value after the finding the anti-derivative of f(x)

> [!example]
> - Measures the **Sign Area** under a velocity/time graph is the **total distance** traveled
