## Abstract
- A method of determining which [[Trace]] to record 
- With the increasing complexity of such applications, it's often not feasible to record every single trace, due to the sheer volume of data it would produce. 
- Thus, *sampling strategies* are employed to only record a subset of all traces


## Sampling Strategies
### Head-based

- Better predictability, but may have potential blind spots
