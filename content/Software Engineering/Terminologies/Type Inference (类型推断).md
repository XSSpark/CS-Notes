## Abstract
---
- [[Language Processors#Compiler]] or [[Interpreter]] automatically figure out the [[Datatype]] based on the context
- For example, in [[[Java]], we can do `List<Integer> intList = new ArrayList<>()` instead of `List<Integer> intList = new ArrayList<Integer>()`, the Compiler is smart enough to figure out the [[Datatype]] for `ArrayList` based on the context provided by `List<Integer>`


>[!success] Reduce boilerplate code - more concise & readable
