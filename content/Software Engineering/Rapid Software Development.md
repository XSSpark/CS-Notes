## Abstract
- A way to quickly build up a software system without sacrificing quaility. The aim is to build a software that fulfil the users' need in a short frame of time - 60-90 days. Based on the 80:20 laws, 80% of the required funtionality usually can be completed with 20% of the development lifecycle. Then we get the users onboard to the software, collect feedback and refine the software. This enables us to avoid long development lifecycle before we have something working for the users to test out, and ensure users are invovled in the early stage of the development lifecycle, so the software is built to their changing needs
