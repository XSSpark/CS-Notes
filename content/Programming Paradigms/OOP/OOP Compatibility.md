## Abstract
---
* Ability to substitute [[OOP#OOP Object]] of *base class* with its objects of its child class  without alternating the behaviour/characteristics of the program
- Basically, with the same set of operation, we expect the parent & its child objects behave in the same way
- The child shouldn't have conflicts with its parents x)
