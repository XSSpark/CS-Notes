## Abstract
- [[Pointer]] that is passed to a function as an argument
- The value of the argument pointer is the address of the argument
- This means that the function can access and modify the value of the argument


## Benefits
### Save on Computation & Memory
- It is expensive to duplicate a large argument like a *matrix*, both computationally and memory usage
