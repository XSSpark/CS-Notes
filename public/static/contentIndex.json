Use variables carefully §\n\nGive variables defined types\n\n4. Expose Outputs §\n5. Use data sources §\n6. Limit the use of custom scripts §\n\nPut custom scripts called by Terraform in a scripts/ directory\n\n7. Include helper scripts in a separate directory §\n8. Put static files in a separate directory §\n\nStatic files that Terraform references but doesn’t execute (such as startup scripts loaded onto Compute Engine instances) must be organized into a files/ directory.\nFor files that are read in by using the Terraform templatefile function, use the file extension .tftpl. Templates must be placed in a templates/ directory\n\n9. Protect stateful resources §\n\nSee docs\n\n10. Use built-in formatting §\n11. Limit the complexity of expressions §\n12. Use count for conditional values §\n13. Use for_each for iterated resources §\n\nRefer to RAiD Terraform codes on the public_subnet and private_subnet setup\nfor_each is only for map or set\nUse count to loop through a list of elements\n\nresource &quot;aws_efs_mount_target&quot; &quot;main&quot; {\n\tcount = length(var.private_subnet_ids)\n\t\n\tfile_system_id = aws_efs_file_system.main.id\n\tsubnet_id = var.private_subnet_ids[count.index]\n}\nReusable modules §\nTerraform root modules §\n1. Minimize the number of resources in each root module §\n\nA general rule: Don’t include more than 100 resources (and ideally only a few dozen) in a single [Terraform State]\n\n7. Store variables in a tfvars file §\n\nFor root modules, provide variables by using a terraform.tfvars Terraform tfvars File (terraform.tfvars)\n"},"Tools/Terraform/Terraform-Functions":{"title":"Terraform Functions","links":["tags/terraform","Terminologies/Base-64"],"tags":["terraform"],"content":"#terraform\nExamples (Functions I used before) §\n\n\n                  \n                  Note base64encode\n                  \n                \nApplies Base64 encoding to a string\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Note filebase64sha256\n                  \n                \nHash the content of the given file &amp; encodes it with Base 64\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Note base64sha256\n                  \n                \nComputes the SHA256 hash of a given string &amp; encodes it with Base 64\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Reference \n                  \n                \nAll Terraform Functions\n"},"Tools/Terraform/Terraform-Loops":{"title":"Terraform Loops","links":[],"tags":["terraform"],"content":"Abstract §\nUse Array elements as map keys §\noutput &quot;aws_lb_target_group_attachment&quot; {\n\tvalue = {\n\t\tfor subnet_id in toset(module.networking.private_subnet_ids) :\n\t\tsubnet_id =&gt; module.alb.network_ip[subnet_id].private_ip\n\t}\n \n}"},"Tools/Terraform/Terraform-Paths":{"title":"Terraform Paths","links":["tags/terraform","Terraform-Module"],"tags":["terraform"],"content":"#terraform\n${path.module} §\n\nGives the relative path to the Terraform Module\nAllows us to call call files inside the module while we are executing terraform apply in the root module directory\n"},"Tools/Terraform/Terraform-Template-File-(.tpl)":{"title":"Terraform Template File (.tpl)","links":["tags/terraform"],"tags":["terraform"],"content":"#terraform\n\n\n                  \n                  Passing 4 variables to the .tpl file \n                  \n                \nuser_data = base64encode(templatefile(&quot;./userdata.tpl&quot;, { kms_key = aws_kms_key.vault.id, vault_url = &quot;https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault/1.14.1/vault_1.14.1_linux_amd64.zip&quot;, aws_region = &quot;ap-southeast-1&quot;, table_name = aws_dynamodb_table.vault_storage.name }))\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Warning \n                  \n                \n\nAvoid the use of Template Module, it is deprecated &amp; doesn’t support M1\nUse templatefile Functioninstead, as shown above\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  References \n                  \n                \n\nTerraform template | How to use terraform template - Part 20\n\n"},"Tools/Terraform/Terraform-tfvars-File-(terraform.tfvars)":{"title":"Terraform tfvars File (terraform.tfvars)","links":["tags/terraform"],"tags":["terraform"],"content":"#terraform\nAbstract §\n\nThe recommended way to pass variables into Terraform\nTerraform auto loads tfvars files only when they are named terraform.tfvars or terraform.tfvars.json or any files with names ending in .auto.tfvars or .auto.tfvars.json\n\nUse Cases §\nTesting infra in different env §\nterraform plan -var-file=”prod.tfvars”\n \nterraform plan -var-file=”stg.tfvars”"},"Tools/Terraform/Terraform":{"title":"Terraform","links":["tags/terraform","User-Data","System-Design/Load-Balancers/Layer-4-Load-Balancer","Networking/Transport-Layer/TLS/X.509-Certificate/Self-signed-Certificate"],"tags":["terraform"],"content":"#terraform\n\nTerraform Installation\n\nInjecting values into file dynamically §\n\nUser Data example\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDependencies §\n\nWhen some resources need to use other resources’ info.
