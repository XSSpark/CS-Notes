    <description>#problem_solving Note Basically obtaining another piece of information based on reflection/symmetry, basically buy one get one free Example 1: Approaching a problem related to Circle, Inscribed Angle Theorem Since the angle is 90degrees, 2 out 3 sides are the same.</description>

    <title>2. Giving things (meaningful) names</title>

    <guid>https://notes.yxy.ninja/Problem-solving/2.-Giving-things-(meaningful)-names</guid>
    <description>#problem_solving Give names to objects that describes its properties (Or to differentiate each one) It is like forming an abstraction over something, then we have more brain power to build on top of it Example 1: Approaching a problem related to Circle, Inscribed Angle Theorem Give Θ (Theta) a name .</description>

    <description>#problem_solving Note Look at what is given Ask the definition of each term How the ideas piece up together Example 1: Approaching a problem related to Circle, Inscribed Angle Theorem We are given a Circle Definition of Circle It has a radius which is a line from the center of circle to its circumference Piece the ideas up Any lines from the center of circle to its circumference is the same length .</description>

    <description>#problem_solving Note Basically explaining something in 2 different perspectives. For example, counting the possible permutation of a string of 5bits.</description>

    <title>Integer Encoding</title>
    <link>https://notes.yxy.ninja/Computer-Organisation/Number-System/Binary-Encoding/Integer-Encoding</link>
    <guid>https://notes.yxy.ninja/Computer-Organisation/Number-System/Binary-Encoding/Integer-Encoding</guid>
    <description>Abstract § There are 3 Variants, computer use the 2’s Complement (补码) variant to store integer Below is a 4-bits Integer Encoding under the 3 Variants 3 Variants § Sign-and-Magnitude (原码) § 1’s Complement (反码) § 2’s Complement (补码) § Terminologies § Sign Bit § The first bit from left 0 denotes positive 1 denotes negative Magnitude § All the bits in the encoding except Sign Bit .</description>

    <description>Abstract § Represent positive and negative decimal integers in binary Divide the number of bits into 2 parts, one part for negative number, another part for positive number Cons § Require extra Logic Gates § The Adder logic cant be used for subtraction This can be avoided using 1’s Complement (反码) or 2’s Complement (补码) Reference § Sign-and-Magnitude Addition and Subtraction Hello-Algo .</description>

    <title>2&#039;s Complement (补码)</title>

    <guid>https://notes.yxy.ninja/Computer-Organisation/Number-System/Binary-Encoding/2's-Complement-(%E8%A1%A5%E7%A0%81)</guid>
    <description>Abstract § We are adding extra 1 to the 1’s Complement (反码), positive number remain unchanged This makes sure that there is only one 0 by adding 1 to after converting from Sign-and-Magnitude (原码) to 1’s Complement (反码) After computation, take the value Sign Bit (negative if it is 1) and perform addition with value of whole Magnitude (all are positive) This is the form that computers use to store integers References § 2’s Complement Addition and Subtraction .</description>

    <description>Abstract § For negative number, all bits are inverted except the Sign Bit which is 1 when we need to perform the computation For positive number, all bits remind the same After the computation, we invert all bits except Sign Bit to obtain the final answer.</description>

    <title>Mathematical Statement</title>

    <guid>https://notes.yxy.ninja/Math/Discrete-Math/Mathematical-Statement</guid>
    <description>Abstract § Also known as Proposition 3 important types are Universal, Conditional &amp; Existential We can form statements that are Universal &amp; Conditional, or more to form complex statements Either True or False Warning Doesn’t depend on any Variable, unless it is Logical Equivalence equation Not in a question form Different Types of Statements § Universal § Made of Symbol, Variable &amp; Quantifiers ∀x∈D,Q(x) true iff Q(x) is true for every x in D false iff Q(x) is false for at least one x in D For simple ones, usually universal comes wiht Conditional Statement Existential § Made of Symbol, Variable &amp; Quantifiers ∃x∈D,Q(x) true iff Q(x) is true for at least one x in D false iff Q(x) is false for all x in D For simple ones, usually existential comes with Conjunction Negation of Universal § Logical Equivalence to Existential There is AT LEAST ONE that IS NOT ¬(∀x∈D,Q(x))≡∃x∈D,¬Q(x) Negation of Existential § Logical Equivalence to Universal ALL ARE NOT ¬(∃x∈D,Q(x))≡∀x∈D,¬Q(x) Negation of Universal Conditional § Make use of Negation of Universal &amp; Implication Law Universal Conditional § Made of Symbol, Variable &amp; Quantifiers &amp; Conditional Statement ∀x(ifP(x)→Q(x)) Can be simplified to Universal ∀x∈P,Q(x) Conditional § Conditional Statement If…, then… Terminologies § Statement § A sentence that is True or False, but not both Can be presented with variables like p, q, r &amp; s etc Logical Connectives § Negation: NOT performed first Disjunction: OR ,Conjunction: AND coequal, make sure proper parentheses is used to avoid Ambiguous If-then/implies: performed last, coequal with iff Statement/Propositional Form § Make up with Statement variables &amp; Logical Connectives Compound Statement § Make up with Statement variables &amp; Logical Connectives When the statement has Conditional Statement, convert it using Implication Law to make it much less confusing Tautology t § Statement/Propositional Form that is always true Contradiction c § Statement/Propositional Form that is always false Implicitly Quantified § The Quantifiers are assumed without specified explicitly Vacuous Truth of Universal § Given the statement: All balls in the bowl are blue, however no balls in the bowl.</description>
